# tothemoon
A game on a blockchain


General Game concept


To the MOON

You are a lunar colony that starts on a moon/planet. The goal of the game is to colonize your planet and grow your empire. Your colony will be constantly fighting against the environment, other players, and pirates. As you gather resources from your planet you will be able to build building and _______ that let you (progress)

Trading will be handled by selling your goods to the spacestation contract that will take your order and wait for a new order to come in that matches your order. Other players who want to be pirates will be able to try to steal your order. Maybe there is a message that says player A sent 100 iron to the spacestation, to encourage people to trade, but also allow the pirates to know what they need to buy/sell in order to scam the player.



Tiles will have resources at varying levels. Iron 1-3 would be 1 iron, 2 iron, or 3 iron per time.


You start with a beginning base on the moon. You base will allow you to get basic resources like food, water, and fuel, at a very slow rate from the beginning. You will also start with a few Space credits allowing you to buy scouts (which explore your world for you). To claim your resources from the tiles your working you have to call the function/pay. So we should have a way to track the current resource times.

Resources will be used to build buildings, which give better resources and require research to unlock. You get research by funding science experiments?? So say you want some new technology that gives the building “Solar Well” that converts ice to water on a tile. You have to spend so many credits/man hours/people/resources to unlock that over a period of time. So you research this technology, then once its unlocked, you buy some buildings on the tiles. But as time goes on you will have to repair those buildings.

All buildings have durability, and will break after so many uses. Same for tile improvements.

Events will come randomly (based off something idk we need to figure it out)

Storms to destroy tile improvements
Raiders to attack and kill your place if you dont have good defence
Safety malfunction / explosion
Reduced production
